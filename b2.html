    </div>
    <p class="description" id="q51Description" style="display: none;">
        Answer: C. Concrete block walls<br>
        Concrete block is one of the most common masonry units. It consists of hardened cement and may be completely solid or contain single or multiple hollows. It is made from conventional cement mixes and various types of aggregates. These include: sand, gravel, crushed stone, expanded shale or clay, volcanic ciders (Pozzolana), scoria, pumice, etc. Various types of blocks are manufactured to be used for wall construction.
        <br><br>
        Panel or Composite Walls: Panel walls are used whenever the load bearing function of the walls is taken over by a framework, which leaves the spaces in the uprights to be filled. Generally, they consist of two or more layers or sections each of which fulfills a specific purpose. They are principally used with the object of reducing weight. Requirements to be fulfilled are resistance to wind pressure, protection against wind and rain, and providing satisfactory appearance. Some of the materials used for panel wall construction are Aluminum panels, Gypsum panels, Glass, etc.

    </div>
    <p class="description" id="q53Description" style="display: none;">
        Answer: C. Lintels<br>
        Arches: An arch is normally a curved member of stone, concrete, steel, etc. Arches are constructed where; loads are heavy, span is large, strong abutments are available, and architectural appearance is required.
        <br><br>
        Lintels: A lintel is a horizontal member, which is placed across the opening. Lintels are easy to build and the supporting walls need not be very strong. At least 10cm length of bearing is a minimum requirement. For very long spans, the bearing for the lintel end should be equal at least to its depth.

    </div>
    <p class="description" id="q54Description" style="display: none;">
        Answer: A. Stairs<br>
        Stairs are a set of steps leading from one floor to another and are provided in buildings to afford a means of communication between the various floors. A set of steps arranged in series and placed in an enclosure is called a Stair Case. Stairs should be designed properly to provide proper ventilation and light (natural). The location of stairs should be near the main entrance for public buildings, centrally placed for easy access, and should give privacy in residential buildings.
        <br><br>
        The primary functions of stairs are:<br>
        1. Provide a means of circulation between floor levels.<br>
        2. Establish a safe means of travel between floor levels.<br>
        3. Provide an easy means of travel between floor levels.<br>
        4. Provide a means of conveying fittings and furniture between floor levels.

    </div>
    <p class="description" id="q58Description" style="display: none;">
        Answer: A. Dog-legged stair<br>
        Straight stairs: This stair runs straight between the two floors. It may be used for small houses where there are restrictions in available width or for the entrance of buildings. The stair may consist of either one single flight or more than one flight (usually two) with a landing.
        <br><br>
        Quarter turn stairs: It is a stair type which changes its direction either to the left or to the right. The turn is designed either by introducing a quarter space landing or by providing winders. Quarter turn stairs are of two types:<br>
        A. Newel quarter turn stairs: These stairs have the conspicuous newel posts at the beginning and end of each flight. At the quarter turn, there may either be a quarter space landing or there may be winders.<br>
        B. Geometrical quarter turn stairs: The stringer as well as the handrail is continuous, with no newel post at the landing.
        <br><br>
        Half turn stairs: It is the one which has its direction reversed or changed for 180°. Such stairs are quite commonly used. Half turn stairs are of three types:<br>
        A. Dog-legged or newel half turn stairs: The name is given because of its appearance in sectional elevation. It comes under the category of newel stairs in which newel posts are provided at the beginning and end of each flight. These may be of two types: with half space landing and with quarter space landing and winders.<br>
        B. Open newel half turn stairs: This stair type has a space or well between the outer strings. This is the only aspect in which it differs from the dog-legged stairs. Additional width is required between the two flights. When the space provided is more, a small flight containing two to four steps may be introduced.<br>
        C. Geometrical half turn stairs: The essential features of such stairs are that the stringers and the handrails are continuous, without any intervening newel post. This may be either with half-space landing or without.
        <br><br>
        Three quarter turn stairs: It has its direction changed three times with its upper flight crossing the bottom one. It may either be newel type or open newel type. Such type of stair is used when the length of the stair room is limited and when the vertical distance between the two floors is quite large.
        <br><br>
        Bifurcated stairs: The stair has a wider flight at the bottom, which bifurcates into two narrow flights one turning to the left and the other to the right, at the landing. It may be either of newel type with a newel post or of geometrical type. This type of stair is commonly used in public buildings at their entrance hall.
        <br><br>
        Continuous stairs: These are types of stairs which do neither have any landing nor any intermediate newel post; and they are geometrical in shape. Continuous stairs may be of three types:<br>
        A. Circular stairs: This stair has a circular plan configuration.<br>
        B. Spiral stairs: They are usually made either of R.C.C. or metal. They are employed at a location where there are space limitations. They are also used as emergency stairs and are provided at the back side of the building. All the steps are winders. Therefore they are not comfortable.<br>
        C. Helical stairs: Looks very fine but its structural design and construction is very complicated. It is made of R.C.C. in which a large portion of steel is required to resist bending, shear and torsion.

    <p class="description" id="q63Description" style="display: none;">Answer: B. Internal Door
        <br> The size of the door should be such that it would allow the movement of largest object or tallest person likely to use the door. As, a rule the height of a door should not be less than 1.8-2.0 m. The width of the door should be such that two persons can pass through it walking shoulder to shoulder. The common width height relations are: 
Width = 0.4 to 0.6 height 
Height = (width + 1.2) meters. 

The following are the generally adopted size of doors for residential building: 
External door: 0.9-1.2m width and 2-2.1m height 
Internal door: 0.8-0.9m width and 2-2.1m height 
Bath room & WC 0.7-0.8m width and 2-2.1m height 
Garages for cars 2.25-2.4m width and 2-2.25m height

    </div>
    <p class="description" id="q64Description" style="display: none;">Answer: A. Revolving Doors
     <br>Classification based on working operations 
1 Revolving doors: Revolving doors are provided in public buildings such as museums, libraries, hotels, banks, etc. where there are constant visitors. Such a door provides entrance to one and exit to the other person simultaneously and closes automatically when not in use. The door consists of a centrally placed mullion to which four radiating shutters are attached.

2 Sliding doors: The shutter can slide upward, downward or sideways. The shutter slides to the sides with the help of runners and guide rails. The door may have one two or even three shutters, depending upon the size of the opening and space available on sides for sliding.

3 Swing doors: The most common type of door movement is the swinging door either right or left, depending on which side is the hinge. Swinging doors may be hinged at the side to open and shut in one direction (single swings) or they may be double acting doors, which swing in both ways (double swinging).

4 Collapsible steel doors: These types of doors are used in workshops, sheds, public buildings, etc for providing increased safety and protection to property. The door neither requires hinges, for opening and closing, nor any frame for hanging them. It acts like a steel curtain which can be opened or closed by horizontal push. It is used even in residential buildings where opening is large but there is no enough space to accommodate leafed shutters.

5 Rolling steel shutter doors: These doors are commonly used for garages, shop fronts, show windows etc., since they are quite strong and offer proper safety to the property. The door consists of a frame, a drum and a shutter of thin steel plates (known as laths or slates) interlocked together. Rolling shutters are of two types: Pull-push type shutters and Mechanical gear type shutters.

Classification based on working operations 
1 Framed and panelled doors: These types of doors are widely used in almost all types of building since they are strong and give better appearance. This door consists of a frame work of vertical members (called styles) and horizontal members, called rails which are grooved along the inner edges of the frame, to receive the panels.

2 Glazed doors or sash doors: They are provided where additional light is required to be admitted to the room through the door, or where the visibility of the interior of the room is required from adjacent room. They are used in residential as well as public buildings like hospitals, schools, colleges, etc. The doors may be either fully glazed, or they be partly glazed and partly panelled.

3. Flush doors: These doors consist of solid or semi-solid skeleton or core covered on both sides with plywood, face veneers, etc. presenting flush and joint-less surface. Flush doors are becoming increasingly popular these days because of their pleasing appearance, simplicity of construction, less cost, better strength and durability. 
They are used both for residential as well as public and commercial buildings. Flush doors are of two types: 
A. Solid core flush door or laminated core flush door. 
B. Hollow and cellular core flush door.

4 Louvered doors (Venetian doors): Louvered doors permit free ventilation through them, and at the same time maintain the privacy of the room. These doors are generally used for latrines and bath rooms of residential and public buildings. The door may either be louvered to its full height, or it may be partly louvered and partly paneled. The louvers are arranged at such an inclination that the vision is obstructed while they permit the passage of air. Louvers may be either fixed or movable and they may be made of either timber or glass or ply wood.

5 Wire gauged doors: These types of doors are provided to check the entry of flies, mosquitoes, insects, etc. Wire mesh is provided in the panels, and therefore, they permit free passage of air. Such doors are commonly used for refreshment rooms, hotels, cup boards containing food and sweet shops.

Classification based on working operations 
1 Battened and ledged doors: This is the simplest type of door, especially suitable for narrow openings. It is formed of vertical bonds; known as battens which are fixed together by horizontal supports known as ledges.

2 Battened, ledged and braced doors: These doors are an improved form of the previous one in which additional inclined (or diagonal) members called braces are provided.

3 Battened, ledged and frame doors: This door is also an improved form of simple battened and ledged door, in which frame work for the shutter is provided in the form of two verticals, known as styles.

4 Battened, ledged, braced and frame doors: This is a modification of the above, with the provision of additional braces, provided diagonally b/n the ledges to increase its strength, durability and appearance.

    </div>
    <p class="description" id="q69Description" style="display: none;">Answer: C. Bulletproof glass
  The various types of glass used in construction of doors and windows are: 
a. Plate glass: plate glass is transparent and flat glass having plain polished surfaces and showing no distortion when through it objects are viewed at any angle. The thickness of plan glass varies from 3 to 6mm. 
b. Clear window glass: Clear widow glass is transparent, having plain and smooth surface. However, small waviness of surface is present which is visible when viewed at an angle. The thickness of clear window glass varies from2.5 to 7.5mm. 
c. Obscured glass: One side of this glass is patterned while rolling which obscures direct vision but does not obstruct light. Figured glass or rough cast glass is example of this type. 
d. Processed glass: There are many patterns and some provide the privacy with a uniform diffusion of light. The primary functions of patterned glasses are the diffusion of light, decoration and privacy. By means of patterned glass, rooms can be adequately day lighted far from windows. Small sky lights can furnish diffused light over a wider area. 

e. Wired glass: Rolled flat glass having wire mesh embedded in it is called wired glass. Wired glass provides safety against breakage and has better fire resistance. 
f. Prism glass: This has prism shaped prim for deflecting light. The prisms with different angles are available to suit various needs. 
g. Quartz glass: Quartz glass transmits ultraviolet rays and is used in hospital where maximum benefit from sun’s rays is desired for the health of the patients. 
h. Bullet proof glass: Bullet proof glass is made of laminated plate glass which may break under impact but will not shatter. The properties of glass can be controlled by adding various metallic oxides or by coating one side with metallic films, oxides or paint. The tints and coatings will filter light, conduct electricity, reflect heat and light, reduce the reflection of light, or impart brilliant colors and decorative effects.

    Single roof: This roof consists of common rafters that are secured at the ridge and wall plates.<br>
    Double or Purlin roof: Additional members called purlins are introduced to support the common rafter at intermediate point. The purlins are used to tie the rafters together and act as intermediate support.<br>
    Trussed roof: Trussed roofs are usually used when the span exceeds 5m and where there are no inside walls to support purlins. The spacing of trusses depends upon the various factors, such as loads on roof, position of cross walls, span, material of truss, etc. and are spaced not more than 3m center to center. There are three elements in a trussed roof system: <br>
    • Rafters which support the roofing materials,<br>

    <p class="description" id="q76Description" style="display: none;">Answer: A. Thatch roof covering<br>
    Thatch roof coverings: It is one of the most ancient types of roof covering and is mainly used in village areas. Thatch roof cover is suitable for rural buildings mainly because the cost is very low and thatch is abundantly available in those regions.<br>
    Galvanised corrugated iron/steel sheet: Galvanization means that the iron/steel sheet is covered with a thin layer of zinc to protect it from rusting. The corrugation means that the sheet is made more resistant to bending stresses lengthwise. The gauge indicates the thickness G-24=0.549mm, G-26=0.457mm, G-28=0.376mm, G-30=0.315mm, G-32=0.274mm and G-35=0.2mm.<br>
    Flat roof is nearly flat slab, with angles less than 100 for drainage purpose. This roof requires very reliable water proofing and heat insulating material. Flat roof has high initial cost. Flat roof is commonly constructed using reinforced concrete.<br>
    Dome is a roof of semi-spherical or semi-elliptical shape. Materials used are stone, brick, concrete or metals (sky lights). They are common in large buildings because they don't need intermediate support. Domes are structurally different from arches as they are slabs in a different setting and they require massive or strong abutment.<br>

    Defects in plastering<br>
    Some of the defects in plastered work include cracking, blistering, efflorescence, and falling out of plaster.<br>
    a. Cracking in plastering<br>
    The major causes of cracking in plastering can be:<br>
    i. Structural defects in the building and discontinuity of surface,<br>
    ii. Plastering on a very wet background,<br>
    iii. Old surface not being properly prepared,<br>
    iv. Movement in the background due to thermal expansion or rapid drying of the backing surface,<br>
    v. Movements in the plaster itself, due to expansion as in the case of gypsum plaster or due to shrinkage of plaster's coat during drying as in the case of lime-sand plasters,<br>
    vi. Excessive shrinkage of the plaster due to a thick coat,<br>
    vii. Due to faulty workmanship or method of application.<br>
    b. Blistering or blowing of plaster<br>
    This consists of the formation of one or more swellings in small patches over the finished plastered surfaces. It is caused due to faulty slaking of lime particles in the plaster after its application.<br>
    c. Falling out of plaster<br>
    Some portions of the surface come off (peeling) due to:<br>
    • Lack of adhesion,<br>
    • Excessive moisture in the background,<br>
    • Excessive thermal changes in the background,<br>
    • Rapid drying of plaster coats,<br>
    • Insufficient drying between each coat of plaster.<br>
    d. Efflorescence<br>
    Efflorescence is the whitish crystalline substance that appears on the surface of walls due to the presence of salts in the lime, cements, and bricks, and sometimes even in water. Efflorescence can be rectified or checked by the following measures:<br>
    i. By scrubbing with brushes. It can also be removed by applying a solution of 1:5 HC:H2O or H2SO4 and spraying with clean water,<br>
    ii. By using burnt bricks and clean water, which are free from salt,<br>
    iii. Using a mortar, which is waterproof, is also useful in preventing efflorescence.<br>
    e. Faulty workmanship<br>
    The following points can be cited as major workmanship errors in plastering:<br>
    i. Excessive trawling may cause the binder to come to the surface,<br>
    ii. The interval between successive applications may be short,<br>
    iii. The coats may have been too thick,<br>
    iv. The addition of water to hydraulic lime after the initial set has taken place may be harmful.<br>

    <p class="description" id="q80Description" style="display: none;">Answer: C. Efflorescence<br>
    Defects in Painting Work<br>
    Some of the usual defects in painting works are:<br>
    a. Blistering: This defect occurs by the formation of bubbles under the paint film. It is generally caused due to an excess of oil in the final coat and imperfect seasoning of timber.<br>
    b. Crawling: This occurs due to the application of too thick coat. It can be rectified by sandpapering the surface.<br>
    c. Grinning: This is a clear reflection of the background due to the lack of opacity of the final coat of paint.<br>
    d. Fading: This is the loss of paint color due to the effect of sunlight on pigments of paint.<br>
    e. Flashing: This is the appearance or reflection of glossy patches on the painted surface due to either workmanship or cheap paint used or due to weather effect.<br>
    f. Saponification: This is the chemical formation of soap patches on the painted surface due to the chemical action of alkalis.<br>

    </div>
    <p class="description" id="q81Description" style="display: none;">Answer: B. Varnishing<br>
    Varnish is a solution of resinous substance in oil, turpentine, or alcohol. The varnish solution on drying or evaporation forms or leaves a hard, transparent, and glossy film of resin on the varnish surface. Varnishing is the process of applying varnish to the wooden surfaces and also to the painted surface in order to improve their appearance and protect them from atmospheric action.<br>
    Distempering is the process of applying distempers over the various surfaces more easily and with less cost than paints and varnishes, to safeguard them against weather effects and improve their appearance. Distempers are considered to water paints, consisting of whiting (i.e., powdered chalk), glue, or casein as a binder, and a suitable proportion of coloring pigments if desired. Distempers form a cheap, durable, and easily applied decoration for internal use on plastered, cement concrete, and various wallboard surfaces.</p>

    </div>
    <p class="description" id="q83Description" style="display: none;">Answer: B. Damping<br>
    One of the basic requirements of a building is that it should remain dry or free from moisture passing through walls, roofs, or floors. Dampness is the presence of hygroscopic or gravitational moisture. It leads to unhygienic conditions affecting badly the health and comfort of the inhabitants. It also seriously deteriorates the stability of the building. Damp prevention is, therefore, one of the important items of building design.<br>
    Source of dampness<br>
    The following causes are considered to be the main sources of dampness in buildings:<br>
    a. Moisture rising up the walls from the ground:<br>
    - All the structures are founded on soils, and the substructure is embedded into it. If the soil is pervious, moisture constantly travels through it.<br>
    - This moisture may rise up into the wall and the floor through capillary action.<br>
    - Groundwater rise will also result in moisture entry into the building through walls and floors.<br>
    b. Rain travel from wall tops:<br>
    - If the wall tops are not properly protected from rain penetration, rain will enter the wall and will travel down.<br>
    - Leaking roofs will also permit water to enter.<br>
    c. Rain Beating Against External Walls:<br>
    - Heavy showers of rain may beat against the external faces of walls and if the walls are not properly treated, moisture will enter the wall, causing dampness in the interior.<br>
    - This moisture travel would completely deface interior decoration of the wall.<br>
    d. Condensation:<br>
    - Due to condensation of atmospheric moisture, water is deposited on the walls, floors, and ceilings. The moisture may cause dampness.<br>
    e. Miscellaneous causes:<br>
    - Moisture may also enter due to the following miscellaneous causes:<br>
    - poor drainage at the building site,<br>
    - Imperfect orientation: walls getting less sunlight and heavy showers may remain damp,<br>
    - Imperfect roof slope: especially in the case of flat roofs,<br>
    - Defective construction: imperfect wall jointing, joints in roofs, defective throating, etc.,<br>
    - Absorption of water from defective rainwater pipes,<br>
    - water introduced in the building during construction,<br>
    - shrinkage of wooden frames permits an entry of rain,<br>
    - Poor material choice, e.g., use of porous bricks in chimneys.<br>

    </div>
    <p class="description" id="q85Description" style="display: none;">Answer: B. Mastic Asphalt<br>
    Mastic asphalt is a semi-rigid material which is quite durable and completely impervious. It is obtained by heating asphalt with sand and mineral fillers. However, it should be laid very carefully by experienced persons, as it can withstand only very slight distortion and is liable to squeeze out in very hot climates or under heavy pressure.<br>
    Hot bitumen, bituminous or asphaltic felt, metal sheets, combination of sheets and bituminous felts, bricks, stones, mortar, cement concrete, and plastic sheets are some of the materials commonly used for damp-proofing in buildings.</p>
